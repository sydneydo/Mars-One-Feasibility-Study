% This script executes theh spares_required_evenDist function with
% parametric input to investigate the effect of different parameters on

% effectively 0

% discretization size
dt = 0.05;

% define processor sets; processors are comprised of the components in rows
% startRow:endRow as encoded in each row of this matrix

% Set up and solve SMP for each processor
% Processors are comprised of subassemblies. Since all processors are
% separated by buffers, each can be considered independently. Failure of a
% subassembly within a processor takes the entire processor online until
% the failed subassembly is replaced with a spare, at which point the
% processor is brought back to nominal working condition.

% load component data. Columns are:
%   1) Mass [kg]
%   2) Volume [m^3]
%   3) MTBF [h]
%   4) # in Processor
componentData = csvread('componentData.csv',1,2);
